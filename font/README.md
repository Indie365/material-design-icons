This directory contains the Material Symbols font files; the older Material Icons (non-variable) fonts are at [/material-icons](https://github.com/google/material-design-icons/tree/master/font/material-icons).

The Material Symbols variable fonts offer weight, optical size, grade and fill variations (with grade and Fill being intended also for animated effects). Material Icons are the non-variable classic icon fonts.

The recommended way to use the Material Symbols font is by linking to the web font hosted on Google Fonts:

```html
<!-- https://material.io/resources/icons/?style=baseline -->
<link href="link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Material+Symbols+Outlined" rel="stylesheet">

```
